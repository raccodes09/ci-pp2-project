## Project Overview

Premier League Quizzers is a quiz website that challenges users on their knowledge of the English Football Premier League. They are asked questions relating to wiiners, records, relegations etc since the Premier leagues inception.

The user is required to enter a username before they can begin quiz, after which they will be asked five questions. They won't know their "full time score" until the answer the last question. Afeter the last question is answered, the user will have their result displayed showing their username and their "score out of five."

The option of a "rematch" using a reset button, will reset the quiz allowing a new user to play.

## Wireframe

Using Balsamiiq Wireframe I was able to design my website before building it. It allowed me to draw up an basic layout of each page I wanted to include.

## Features

- Benefits of Aloe Vera use.
- Contact deatils.
- Sign up form to subscribe to newsletter.
- Images of ALoe Vera.
- Informative video highlighting Aloe Vera as a drink.
- Social Media links to allow user to view social content of website.

The navigation bar includes four clickable links, including the logo acting as a "return to homepage" link. This allows the user to easily access the three pages on the site.

To help with user experience, the header which holds the links, is fixed meaning that it will remain at the top as the user scrolls throughout the page.

Each page is styled in a clean, pleasing to the eye contrast using colours associated with natural living, calmness and nature - the idea behind behind Aloe Vera itself.

## Performance

Using Google Lighthouse within Google Chrome Developer Tools I was able to test the performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO. Overall performance could be improved which I will look at in future updates.

The results shown below:

## Bugs

When screen size reduces to approximately tablet size and below, the Footer blends with body. Working with "sticky footer" coding I have attempted to fix the footer below each section, howvever my attempts have not worked. To resolve this, I will have to style the body in a differnet way.

I overcame this by targeting page-content with overflow-y auto. I know there is perhaps a more efficent/best practice way to make the code more appealing - this will be revisisted in a later update.

Issue regarding the links when screen size reduces. It forces content outside the viewport. I tried to implement the "hamburger" method but was unsuccessful. This will be revisisted in a later update - code will need be rewritten to allow a more positive visual experience as well as general user experience.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
