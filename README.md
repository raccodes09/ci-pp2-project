## Project Overview

Premier League Quizzers is a quiz website that challenges users on their knowledge of the English Football Premier League. They are asked questions relating to wiiners, records, relegations etc since the Premier leagues inception.

The user is required to enter a username before they can begin quiz, after which they will be asked five questions. They won't know their "full time score" until the answer the last question. After the last question is answered, the user will have their result displayed showing their username and their "score out of five."

The option of a "rematch" using a reset button, will reset the quiz allowing a new user to play.

### User Experience

#### Design

- #### ***Font Colour***

- The content is made up of three colours:
  - Green #28a745
  - Purple #6b006b
  - White #FFFFFF

  - The Green #28a745 was chosen as it is associated with football.
  - The Purple #6b006b was chosen as being similar to the the color scheme used by the Premier League website itself. I had chosen a slightly lighter purple in comparison as I felt the darker purple did not contrast well with the shade of Green I chose.
  - Both colors together with the white contrasts really well helping user experience.

- #### ***Typography***

  - The font syles of Lisu Bosa for the main body text and "Barriecito" for the headings works well together and represents the intention of the quiz. 
  - The "Barriecito" in particular works well as it gives off a "quizicle" style.


## Wireframe

Using Balsamiiq Wireframe I was able to design my website before building it. It allowed me to draw up an basic layout of each page I wanted to include.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

- HTML

- CSS3

- JavaScript

### Frameworks, Libraries & Other Resources

1. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google Fonts was used to import fonts into the style.css file.

1. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Font Awesome provideds small graphics to complement the logo and various headers.

1. [Git:](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

1. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub used to store the code whoch was pushed from Git.

1. [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Balsamiq was used to design the wireframes

1. [Chrome DevTools:](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
    - Chrome DevTools used to check the site in terms of responsivity, amending code and trying various styles. The Lighthouse feature was used to test performance.

1. [Am I Repsonsive:](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
    - Am I repsonive used to check responsivity across all devices.


## Validator Testing

[W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to HTML code.

    - [HTML](/assets/testing/validation-pdf/html-validation.pdf)


[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) was used to validate CSS code.

    - [CSS](/assets/testing/validation-pdf/css-validation.pdf)


[WAVE Testing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh) was used to test accessibility of website. No errors were found other than empty form label - this is intended as I am using placeholder text for instruction and visually more attractive without a label.


[JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate JavaScript code.

    - [JavaScript](assets/testing/validation-pdf/js-hint-validation-result.pdf)


## User Testing

- Feedback from user testing was postive.
- Reviews suggested that:
    - the website was easy to navigate
    - the colors worked well together
    - the layout and structure of the questions made the intention clear
    - would benefit from a scorecard saving previous user scores
    - more questions

- The webiste worked efficently and without issue across laptop, tablet and mobile phone devices.


## Performance

Using Google Lighthouse within Google Chrome Developer Tools I was able to test the performance, accessibility, best practice and SEO. Overall performance could be improved which I will look at in future updates.

The results shown below:

## Bugs

- The alert for when no username has been entered and the "Kick-Off" button is pressed does not appear. I have tested this on several browsers and re-written the code but at this time, no fix is in place. I have tested this while ensuring pop-up blockers are disabled but this has not resolved the issue.
  
- The question container resizes depending on length of question being asked. Code would need to be we-written to maintain constant size and for the question text to wrap within the container.

## Future Implementations

- Scoreboard where previous users and their scores are saved which would add further competitivness to the quiz.
  
- Investigate the usage of an API to generate a larger bucket of questions and randomise the questions on each turn
  
- Add animation for when user logs in and also when their final result is revealed, for example, a football being kicked.
